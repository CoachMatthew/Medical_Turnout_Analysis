# Analyzing No-Show Factors in Brazilian Healthcare Appointments

This project, I analysed the dataset of more than 110k Brazilian patients from late April to early June 2016. Data shows that in 20% of scheduled appointments, the patient didn't show up. Our goal is trying to answer the question:
what are the factors leading to no_shows?
Is it the system or personal attributes to blame?

The report distinguishes between two groups of factors that might have significance: those related to the system, and personal attributes of the patients themselves.
